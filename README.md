# Tumblr Screenshot Tool Extension

An extension that lets you easily screenshot Tumblr posts. Mostly made for my personal use as a companion to my other
tool the [Tumblr Screenshot Tool](https://github.com/FireIsGood/tumblr-screenshot-tool).

## Installation

I can't be bothered to put this on the chrome store in this state so you'll have to load it manually. Also I only
developed this for myself so it's only on chrome right now.

### Chrome

Before you can install this, you will have to download the repo. Click the green "Code" button near the top of the repo
and click "Download ZIP" to download the repo as a zip file to somewhere on your computer. After you have the file,
unzip it somewhere you can find later.

Then, you can load it into your browser:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click Load Unpacked and open the folder `/src`

### Firefox

Not available (sorry!)
